<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

PAQ Bot is a tool designed to summarize large text PDF documents, and the Bot would also generate responses based on the material you have provided, thus increasing efficiency. This tool is great for students for who want to get quick notes, generate questions for practice and get answers related to their text in an efficient way.  It is particularly useful for professionals, researchers, students, and anyone working with lengthy or complex PDFs, such as academic papers, technical manuals, contracts, or reports. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and the LangChain library, PAQ Bot enables users to query PDFs in natural language, receive context-aware answers, and quickly access relevant information without manually sifting through pages. This makes it an invaluable assistant for streamlining research, summarizing content, and improving productivity when working with document-heavy tasks.
